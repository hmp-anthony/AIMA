    "Previously (link above) we created a graph by finding all vertices visible from a particular vertex, for all vertices. Once the graph was fully formed, we ran a few graph search algorithms on it to find a path from the start to the end. Obviously A-star and uniform-cost search (dijkstra) found the shortest path (the red and green lines). Here we are taking a different approach: We are asked in Exercise 4.11 to turn this problem into an environment problem. No longer do we form a graph by fully surveying the problem then running an algorithm on the graph to obtain a solution. This time we are asked to provide an agent with percepts in the form of a collection of visible vertices. The agent then makes a decision on what action to take: this comes in the form of a vector describing a straight-line path to follow.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the difficulties in this version of the problem is that we have to take into account the size of the agent. For simplicity I am going to assume that the agent is circular. If this was not the case then it is a decent assumption to assume that the agent is bounded by a circular region. In the original problem (3.7, linked above) the agent was a point mass so we did not have to make a distinction between visbility and reachability. This time we are searching for collision between a disk and an obstacle, during the execution of an action. This is commonly referred to as swept collision detection.\n",
