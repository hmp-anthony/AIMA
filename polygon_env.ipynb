    "This was back in the day where I did not realise that there are Markdown cells in a jupyter notebook: the joys of self-learning. Previously (link above) we created a graph by finding all vertices visible from a particular vertex, for all vertices. Once the graph was fully formed, we ran a few graph search algorithms to find a path from the start to the end. Obviously A-star and uniform-cost search (dijkstra) found the shortest path (the red and green lines). Here we are taking a different approach: We are asked in Exercise 4.11 to turn this problem into a environment problem. No longer do we form a graph by fully surveying the problem, then run an algorithm on the graph to obtain a solution. We are asked to provide an agent with percepts in the form of a collection of reachable vertices. The agent then makes a decision on what action to take: this comes in the form of a vector describing a straight-line path to follow.\n",
