    "As per usual the code in the repo for AIMA is, well, broken. So in answering question 4.4 from chapter 4 I fixed it. Note that I am using the search_2 module, which is part of the AIMA repository. See https://github.com/hmp-anthony. In this post I am comparing steepest-ascent hill-climbing ,random-restart hill-climbing and simulated annealing. To keep things fair I am using the same `find_neighbor` method for all three algorithms. This method just selects a random contiguous sub-array, reverses it and puts it back together. The problems that these algorithms will be working on are the 8puzzle problem and the 8queens problem. These are well-known problems in AI, google them! :)"
